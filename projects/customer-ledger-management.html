  <h2>Customer Ledger Management System</h2>

  <!-- Overview -->
  <div class="card">
    <h3>Project Overview</h3>
    <p>
      The Customer Ledger Management System is a web-based solution developed to digitize
      and streamline manual credit and ledger management processes for a retail cloth store.
      The system replaces traditional paper-based bookkeeping with a centralized digital ledger,
      improving accuracy, transparency, and ease of access.
    </p>
    <p>
      The application enables store owners to maintain customer-wise credit records,
      transaction history, and outstanding balances in an organized and secure manner.

  <!-- Problem Statement -->

    <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
    <p>
      Many small retail businesses rely on manual registers or notebooks to manage customer
      credit transactions. These methods are prone to errors, data loss, and lack real-time
      visibility into outstanding balances, making credit management inefficient and unreliable.

  <!-- Proposed Solution -->

    <h3>Proposed Solution</h3>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The system allows easy access to customer records and improves day-to-day financial tracking
      for retail store operations.
