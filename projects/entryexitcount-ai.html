  <h2>Entry Exit Count AI</h2>

  <!-- Overview -->
  <div class="card">
    <h3>Project Overview</h3>
    <p>
      Entry Exit Count AI is a real-time computer vision–based system designed to automatically
      detect, track, and count people entering and exiting a monitored area using CCTV or video feeds.
      The system eliminates manual counting by providing accurate IN and OUT counts through
      intelligent video analytics.
    </p>
    <p>
      The solution is suitable for public places such as malls, offices, institutions, and events
      where crowd monitoring and occupancy tracking are essential for safety and operational efficiency.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- Problem Statement -->
  <div class="card">
    <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
    <p>
      Traditional CCTV systems only record footage without providing actionable insights.
      Manual people counting is time-consuming, error-prone, and not scalable in crowded environments.
      Organizations require an automated solution to monitor entry and exit counts in real time.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- Proposed Solution -->
  <div class="card">
    <h3>Proposed Solution</h3>
    <p>
      The system uses computer vision techniques to detect humans in video frames and track their movement
      across consecutive frames. A virtual line is defined in the camera view, and whenever a person
      crosses this line, the system determines the direction of movement and updates the entry or exit counter.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Flask-based web interface displays live video streams along with real-time counters for monitoring.
    </p>
