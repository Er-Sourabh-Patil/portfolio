<!-- PROJECT REPORT -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>Sentiment Analysis of Social Media Posts (LSTM)</h2>

  <!-- Overview -->
  <div class="card">
    <h3>Project Overview</h3>
    <p>
      This project focuses on developing a deep learning–based sentiment analysis system using Long Short-Term Memory
      (LSTM) networks. The objective of the system is to classify social media text data into
      <strong>positive, negative, or neutral</strong> sentiment categories.
    </p>
    <p>
      Social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and Google Reviews generate large volumes of unstructured text
      data. Analyzing this data helps in understanding user opinions, feedback, and public perception.
    </p>

  <!-- Problem Statement -->
  <div class="card">
    <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
    <p>
      Traditional sentiment analysis techniques struggle to capture contextual meaning and long-term dependencies
      present in natural language. The challenge is to accurately interpret sentiment from social media text that may
      include informal language, varying sentence structures, and contextual dependencies.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- Solution -->
  <div class="card">
    <h3>Proposed Solution</h3>
    <p>
      To address this challenge, an LSTM-based deep learning model was developed. LSTM networks are well-suited for
      sequential data and can effectively capture contextual relationships in text.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trained model was integrated into a Flask-based web application, enabling real-time sentiment prediction
      with an animated sentiment gauge for intuitive visualization.

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      The Sentiment Analysis of Social Media Posts project demonstrates the effective use of LSTM-based deep learning
      models for understanding public sentiment from unstructured text data. The integration of the model into a Flask
      web application highlights its practical usability for real-world sentiment analysis tasks.
